# fibonacci(3) = 2 (fib(1)+fib(2), or 1+1), fibonacci(4) = 3 (1+2), fibonacci(5) = 5 (2+3),

# Kaitlin sees beauty in numbers, but also believes that less is more. 
# Implement sumToOne(num) that sums a given integerâ€™s digits repeatedly until the sum is only one digit. Return that one-digit result.
# Example: sumToOne(928) returns 1, because 9+2+8 = 19, then 1+9 = 10, then 1+0 = 1.
# Solve the challenge WITHOUT using recursion although you are allowed to convert the integer to a string.
